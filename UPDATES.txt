- Reverted PT_code_REV2 to include OG_PT_code's automatic peak-filtering processing as the primary function
- User is able to correct data points as the secondary function
- Improved visualization of graphs
- Organized branched m.files
- Added comments to scripts
- Updated README.txt's instructions and warnings

- Fixed figure position such that the figures (the transducer split graphs and the detonation velocity, and any other sequential graphs) are expanded to ~700-800 pixels tall and wide, with adequate viewing of each.

Disclaimer: these are hardcoded figures dimensions (supposedly), for a 1920 x 1080 display, these figures would take up 80% of your displace. For larger or smaller displays, these can take up significantly smaller or larger portions of your screen respectively.

- Removed the restriction of number of possible selected peaks in the manual mode of code, opening up every possible peak that the hardcoded filter has ran picked up.

Observations: For data that has a lot of noise, the manual will pick up almost all of the noise peaks.

- Fixed "zeroing" issue in correcting peak locations
- Compressed code by removing phase2 and modified phase1
- Figures will close logically on correction phase
- std_num = 10 instead of 5 to improve peak-filtering (will change entire process in next update)

Observations: Some lvm's could not be analyzed due to the std_num (hardcorded)
